# Programming Languages
## Python
* :globe_with_meridians: [Real Python:](https://realpython.com/) Learn all things Python from the ground up. Everything from the absolute basics of Python, to web development and web scraping, to data visualization, and beyond.
* Python 3 Module of the Week: A series of blog posts written by Doug Hellmann. It was started as a way to build the habit of writing something on a regular basis. The focus of the series is building a set of example code for the modules in the Python standard library. :globe_with_meridians: [[blogs]](https://pymotw.com/3/) :octocat: [[code]](https://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/pymotw/)
* :open_file_folder: :globe_with_meridians: [Awesome Python:](https://awesome-python.com/) A curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources. The following are what I find very handy:
